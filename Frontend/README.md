# Cerberus AI - Fraud Detection UI

A sleek, dark-themed transaction anomaly detector interface built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **Lucide Icons**.

## Getting Started

If you are setting this up for the first time, follow these exact steps:

### 1. Install Project & UI Dependencies
Run this in your terminal to get the React core and the specific styling engine I used:
```bash
npm install
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite lucide-react
